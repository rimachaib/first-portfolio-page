        <h3>Welcome to My Portfolio Page</h3>
        <p>I am a software developer based out of San Francisco, California.  I am passionate about exploration, growth, and adaptation and would love to work with people and companies that are building tools to help everyone live and work better.</p>

        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>After spending the last 6 years working as an environmental scientist, I began to notice, that technology was advancing the world so quickly; but, unfortunately my industry was not adapting.  After this realization I felt emboldened to push my technical skill set farther by enrolling in Codecademy's Front End Engineering Career Path with the hopes of one day developing tools that will help my industry work better.</p>  
        <p>When I'm not on my computer, learning new programming languages or furthering my personal projects, you can find me outside, rock climbing, hiking, or running around a brand new city.</p>
